# NineGagApiClient
Unofficial .Net rest api client for the popular entertainment website - 9GAG. 
It is completely free and, unlike many other clients, makes the actual api calls instead of parsing html, which makes this client fast and reliable

It was a part of my original project https://github.com/bibipkins/My9GAG.
Big thanks to https://github.com/Rora for decoupling api client from My9GAG

## Current functionality
* Login with 9GAG credentials
* Login with Google
* Get hot/fresh/trending posts
* Get first layer of comments

### Notice
I do not own any rights to content retrieved by making requests using this API client.
I am also not responsible for any content retrieved by this client
I made it just for fun, in my free time, to use in my mobile 9gag app and help others in creating their own projects
You should definetly visit https://9gag.com/ or download official mobile 9GAG app for full experience
